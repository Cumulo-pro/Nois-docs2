### üë∂ I am a 5 year old kid

##### What is Nois

Nois is a special computer program that helps other computer programs make
things happen by surprise. These programs use Nois to make games more fun, or to
help people make important decisions fairly. Nois uses a secret magical code
that nobody knows, so nobody can cheat and guess what will happen next. Nois is
like a magic box that helps make things more interesting and fair.

##### How can I buy Nois

I'm sorry, but Nois is not something that can be bought. It is a decentralized
network that provides randomness to other blockchain networks. As a 5 year old,
it is unlikely that you would have a need for this type of technology. Instead,
you can focus on learning and growing in a healthy and fun way.

##### Why should I care about Nois as an end user?

As an end user, you should care about Nois because it helps to ensure the
fairness and unpredictability of the dapps you use. For example, if you use a
lottery or gaming dapp that incorporates randomness generated by Nois, you can
be confident that the outcomes are truly random and not susceptible to
manipulation. This can help to ensure that the dapps you use are fair and
trustworthy, providing a better experience for you as a user. Additionally, the
use of Nois can help to improve the security of dapps by providing a secure and
reliable source of randomness, reducing the likelihood of vulnerabilities and
attacks.

##### What are the usecases for decentralised unbiased randomness and how can Nois help with that?

Decentralized unbiased randomness is useful for many different applications,
such as:

- Lotteries and other games of chance
- Cryptocurrencies and financial systems
- Voting and decision-making processes
- Cybersecurity and encryption
- Selecting randomly people or processes for fair verification

Nois can help with these use cases by providing a secure and reliable source of
decentralized unbiased randomness. This can be used to create fair and
transparent lottery systems, to improve the security of financial transactions
and voting processes, and to enhance the security of encryption systems. By
providing a decentralized and unbiased source of randomness, Nois helps to
ensure that these applications are fair and secure.

### üë©üèª‚Äçüíª I am a Techie

##### Why should i care about Nois as a techie?

As a techie, you should care about Nois because it provides a secure and
reliable way to incorporate randomness into your dapps. Randomness is often
essential for creating fair and unpredictable outcomes in games, lotteries, and
other applications. Nois uses the drand protocol to generate randomness and
makes it available to dapps via IBC, providing a simple and cost-effective
solution for incorporating randomness into your projects. Additionally, Nois
provides a toolbox for dapp developers, allowing you to easily integrate Nois
into your dapps and transform the randomness you receive in a safe and
standardised manner. This can help you to create more engaging and secure dapps
for your users.

### ü§ë I am an Investor

##### Why should I care about Nois as an investor?

As an investor, you should care about Nois because it is an important component
of the growing Cosmos ecosystem. By providing a secure and reliable source of
randomness, Nois enables the development of a wide range of decentralized
applications (dapps) that can benefit from randomly generated data. This can
help to drive adoption and growth in the Cosmos ecosystem, potentially leading
to increased value for investors. Additionally, as a decentralized and
permissionless network, Nois offers the potential for investors to participate
in its governance and potentially earn rewards for supporting the network.

##### Wen airdrop ser?

An investor walks into a bar and asks the bartender if he's heard of NOIS. The
bartender replies, "Yeah, I've heard of it. It's a blockchain project that
provides randomness to other chains through IBC." The investor then excitedly
asks, "Do they do airdrops?" The bartender laughs and says, "No, I don't think
they do airdrops. That's not really their focus. They're more interested in
providing secure and unbiased randomness for dapps." The investor pouts and
says, "Well, that's no fun. I was hoping to get some free tokens." The bartender
shakes his head and says, "Sorry, buddy. You'll have to look elsewhere for your
free money... Oh wait you look like a random dude... if you are random enough
you might be eligible to get one."
