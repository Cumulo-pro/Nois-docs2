# Faucet

A faucet is a tool to provide small amounts of tokens for onboarding purposes.
We usually use a faucet channel
[on our Discord server](https://chat.nois.network/). The following faucets are
available.

## Mainnet

There is currently no faucet available. If you are nice in chat, some community
members might be kind enough to gift you some tokens.

## Testnet 004

As Testnet 004 is an almost identical replicate of the mainnet tokenomics, no
faucet is available.

## Testnet 005

Testnet 005 is scheduled for mid April 2023 (i.e. after mainnet launch) as a
long living testnet. It will have a faucet.
